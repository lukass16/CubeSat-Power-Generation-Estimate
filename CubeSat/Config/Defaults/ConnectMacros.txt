' Description: This sub is called after a connection
'     has been terminated. The Connection ID is passed to

'Function Connect_Cmd_MY_COMMAND ( iConnectionId, bstrPath, bstrCmdData, pvarResult )
' Description: Connect will create a macro function name by 
'     concatenating 'Connect_Cmd_' and the upper case Connect Command
'     Verb from a received command. (ex. 'MY_COMMAND')
'     Connect will call the macro
'     prior to attempting to process the MY_COMMAND normally.
'     If MY_COMMAND is an existing Connect command,
'     the MY_COMMAND macro can override the built in MY_COMMAND
'     processing by returning lGiConnectAck or lGiConnectNack and
'     setting the pvarResult parameter accordingly. Otherwise,
'     the macro can return 0 to indicate the existing Connect processing
'     should be attempted.
'     The iConnectionId parameter
'     indicates the connection that the command came in on.
'     The bstrPath parameter contains the Connect command object path.
'     The bstrCmdData parameter contains the Connect command data.
'     The pvarResult parameter is for returning the results.
'     Function return values are interpreted as follows:
'           Value                        Meaning
'           -----            -----------------------------------------

'                             No further Connect Command processing 
'                             is to be done.
'           lGiConnectNack   Command failed in script. Send Nack.
'                             No further Connect Command processing
'                             is to be done.

' Description: This sub is called if a Connect command has
'     resulted in a failure. The iConnectionId parameter
'     indicates the connection that the command came in on.
'     The bstrPath parameter contains the Connect command object path.
'     The bstrCommand parameter contains the Connect command verb.
'     The bstrCmdData parameter contains the Connect command data.
